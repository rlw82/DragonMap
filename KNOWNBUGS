	- MapViewActivity.java - Line 74/141  (Mark)
		App crashes when attempting to set multiple content views
		(i.e.: When setContentView(img) is called multiple times,
		it seems to cause problems.  I think the fix is to "clean"
		the current content view)
		
	- detailedview.xml - <LinearLayout>   (Mark)
		Something in here causes the view to not scroll.  Also
		let's make the page look nicer.  Other than that, I like!
